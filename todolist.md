# To-do list for ZEN_geography repository

- [X] check outputs of model comparison script
- [X] check outputs of data assembly script
- [X] check outputs of figures script
- [X] add zenodo link to genetic analysis - see email from Marlene Jahnke
- [X] add pop gen data - see email from Marlene -  we made it sound like dryad would be the location, but maybe github is okay?
- [X] check minor differences in output from lm's in `ZEN_2014_model_comparison_site_means_range_standardized.R`
- [ ] streamline data assembly script. Because site level data used in models, no need for (ALL?) of the random forest work there
- [ ] check to see if MarineGEO has a git profile (in lieu of email?). We can transfer ownership of the repo to them
- [ ] *Should additional scripts be added? for example, PCA scripts, FCA scripts, other genetic analyses?*
- [ ] check on log-transformation steps - for some variables, zeros become undefined and then omitted



###### DATA SOURCES
- [ ] **Clarify input file origins.** Links to other repos (github/doi), papers (doi), or people? this could all be listed in README.md
- [X] * for Whalen - add a repo for the code that made that environmental data
