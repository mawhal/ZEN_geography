# To-do list for ZEN_geography repository

- [ ] check outputs of model comparison script
- [ ] check outputs of figures script
- [ ] check outputs of data assembly script


### Zipped data file sent by Emmett
- [ ] One file with Zostera Relative Growth rates does not seem to be used, or maybe I am missing something?  `ZEN_2011_ZRG_AllSites_Edit141102 copy.csv`
- [ ] Should additional scripts be added? for example, PCA scripts, FCA scripts, other genetic analyses?



### Data Assembly script

###### PACKAGES
We might want shift away from ddply in plyr to just using tidyverse
- [ ] replace `read.csv()` with `read_csv()`
- [ ] randomForest --- was data actually imputed? make this clear early in the code

###### DATA SOURCES
- [ ] Clarify input file origins. Links to other repos (github/doi), papers (doi), or people?
- [ ] * for Whalen - add a repo for the code that made that environmental data
