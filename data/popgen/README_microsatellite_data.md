# README Duffy et al. 2022-PNAS Supplementary information
## ZEN 2 microsatellite data set
List of all genotyped individuals (n=100) of 50 sites genotyped at 24 loci in one-column format. Each line gives information on one individual. Column A indicates the location it was sampled at and column B gives information on the sample name. Column C-Z show the scored genotype at 24 different loci.
Loci in column C to J are providing information on the original 8 loci  (used in other Zostera marina population geneteic studies). Column K-Z provide information on 16 newly developed loci.
All genotypes are shown here, i.e., duplicate Multi-Locus Genotypes (MLGs) have NOT been removed
