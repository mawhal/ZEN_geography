###### this repository contains data, code, and various outputs associated with the _Zostera_ Experimental Network's evolutionary legacy project
This project considers the ecosystem-wide consequences of evolutionary legacies associated with the establishment and history of _Zostera marina_ (eelgrass) in the Atlantic Ocean relative to its Pacific origins. Atlantic eelgrass differs in size and biomass and these features influence the biomass structure of organisms associated with eelgrass
